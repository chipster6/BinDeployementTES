- **Vulnerability alerts** with immediate scheduling
- **Compliance alignment** with GDPR, PCI DSS, SOC 2 requirements

### 5. Prometheus Alert Rules
**File**: `docker/prometheus/rules/dependency-alerts.yml`
- **Critical vulnerability alerts** with immediate notification
- **Security grade degradation** monitoring
- **System-wide vulnerability tracking** across all components
- **Business impact alerts** for revenue-affecting vulnerabilities
- **Compliance risk alerts** for regulatory impact assessment

### 6. Automation Scripts
**File**: `scripts/automated-dependency-monitoring.sh`
- **Setup automation** for complete monitoring stack
- **Prerequisites validation** for required tools
- **Environment configuration** with secure defaults
- **Initial security scan** execution
- **Monitoring dashboard** status display

## Security Configuration

### Vulnerability Thresholds (Zero Tolerance)
- **Critical**: 0 (immediate alert)
- **High**: 0 (immediate alert)
- **Moderate**: 5 (warning threshold)
- **Low**: 20 (maintenance threshold)

### Alert Channels
- **Webhook notifications** for emergency response systems
- **Slack integration** for team communication
- **Prometheus metrics** for monitoring dashboards
- **GitHub issues** for vulnerability tracking

### Business Impact Protection
- **$2M+ MRR operations** secured with immediate vulnerability response
- **Compliance maintenance** for GDPR, PCI DSS, SOC 2
- **Security grade monitoring** maintaining 92-95% target
- **Zero-downtime updates** with fallback mechanisms

## Current Status Validation

### Dependency Security Audit Results
```bash
npm audit --audit-level moderate
# Result: found 0 vulnerabilities ✅
```

### Package Versions (Security Agent Updated)
- **Express**: 5.1.0 (latest secure version)
- **Stripe**: 18.4.0 (latest secure version)
- **Bcrypt**: 6.0.0 (latest secure version)
- **Helmet**: 8.1.0 (latest secure version)
- **Redis**: 5.8.1 (latest secure version)
- **All 35+ packages**: Updated to latest secure versions

## Integration Points

### Existing Security Infrastructure
- **Coordinates with Security Agent** for vulnerability response
- **Integrates with existing Prometheus monitoring** stack
- **Leverages current Docker monitoring** infrastructure
- **Aligns with production deployment** pipeline

### Monitoring Stack Integration
- **Prometheus metrics export** to existing monitoring
- **Grafana dashboard compatibility** for visualization
- **Alert manager integration** for notification routing
- **Docker compose monitoring** stack support

## Automated Workflows

### Daily Operations
1. **2 AM UTC**: Comprehensive security scan across all ecosystems
2. **Real-time**: Vulnerability detection on dependency changes
3. **Continuous**: Security grade monitoring and alerting
4. **Weekly**: Dependency update recommendations

### Emergency Response
1. **Immediate alerts** for critical/high vulnerabilities
2. **Automatic issue creation** for security incidents
3. **Stakeholder notification** for business-critical vulnerabilities
4. **Escalation protocols** for multiple component failures

## API Usage Examples

### Check Current Security Status
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT_TOKEN" \
     http://localhost:3001/api/v1/dependency-monitoring/status
```

### Trigger Emergency Scan
```bash
curl -X POST \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT_TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"priority": "emergency"}' \
     http://localhost:3001/api/v1/dependency-monitoring/scan
```

### Get Vulnerability Details
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT_TOKEN" \
     "http://localhost:3001/api/v1/dependency-monitoring/vulnerabilities?severity=critical"
```

## Operational Procedures

### Setup Instructions
1. **Environment Variables**: Configure webhook URLs in `.env`
2. **GitHub Actions**: Enable workflow in repository settings
3. **Renovate**: Configure repository integration
4. **Monitoring Stack**: Start with `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.monitoring.yml up -d`

### Maintenance Tasks
- **Weekly**: Review dependency update recommendations
- **Monthly**: Analyze security trends and adjust thresholds
- **Quarterly**: Audit alert effectiveness and response times
- **As needed**: Update webhook configurations and escalation procedures
