# Documentation for `models/index.ts`

## Overview

This file serves as the central hub for all Sequelize models in the application. It is responsible for importing all model definitions, establishing the associations between them, and exporting them for use in other parts of the application.

## Key Features

-   **Model Aggregation**: Imports all Sequelize model definitions from the `models` directory.
-   **Association Management**: Contains the `defineAssociations` function, which sets up all the relationships between the models (e.g., `belongsTo`, `hasMany`).
-   **Initialization**: Provides an `initializeModels` function that defines the associations and, in a development environment, synchronizes the models with the database.
-   **Centralized Exports**: Exports all models, enums, and the database instance, providing a single point of entry for accessing the data layer.

## Functions

### `defineAssociations()`

This function defines all the associations between the Sequelize models. It is called by `initializeModels`.

### `initializeModels(): Promise<void>`

This asynchronous function initializes all the models and their associations. In a development environment, it will also synchronize the models with the database by creating or altering tables as needed.
