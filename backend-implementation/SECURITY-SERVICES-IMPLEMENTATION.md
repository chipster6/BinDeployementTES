## Implementation Details

### Technology Stack
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Framework**: Express.js with BaseService architecture
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with existing AuditLog model
- **Caching**: Redis for high-performance data access
- **Authentication**: JWT RS256 with role-based access control
- **Validation**: Express-validator with comprehensive input validation

### Security Architecture
- Extends existing BaseService pattern
- Integrates with current AuditLog model
- Maintains JWT authentication standards
- Preserves AES-256-GCM encryption
- Follows TypeScript strict compliance
- Implements comprehensive error handling

### Data Models

#### Threat Analysis
```typescript
interface ThreatAnalysisResult {
  threatId: string;
  severity: ThreatSeverity;
  threatType: ThreatType;
  riskScore: number; // 0-100
  confidence: number; // 0-100
  indicators: string[];
  recommendations: string[];
  requiresAction: boolean;
  autoBlockRecommended: boolean;
  processingTime: number;
}
```

#### Security Event
```typescript
interface SecurityEvent {
  id: string;
  type: SecurityEventType;
  severity: SecurityEventSeverity;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  timestamp: Date;
  source: string;
  affectedResources: string[];
  indicators: string[];
  metadata: Record<string, any>;
  status: "new" | "investigating" | "resolved" | "false_positive";
}
```

#### Security Incident
```typescript
interface SecurityIncident {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  category: IncidentCategory;
  severity: IncidentSeverity;
  status: IncidentStatus;
  priority: number; // 1-5
  timeline: IncidentTimelineEntry[];
  responseActions: ResponseAction[];
  affectedSystems: string[];
  affectedUsers: string[];
}
```

#### Compliance Report
```typescript
interface ComplianceReport {
  framework: ComplianceFramework;
  reportPeriod: { startDate: Date; endDate: Date };
  summary: {
    totalEvents: number;
    complianceEvents: number;
    violations: number;
    complianceScore: number; // 0-100
    riskScore: number; // 0-100
  };
  sections: ComplianceSection[];
  recommendations: ComplianceRecommendation[];
}
```
