## Database Schema Optimization

### Partitioning Strategy

**Time Series Partitioning**:
- Monthly partitions for `time_series_metrics` table
- Automatic partition creation via triggers
- Configurable data retention (default: 24 months)
- Partition-specific indexing for optimal performance

### Materialized Views

**Performance-Optimized Views**:
1. `daily_metrics_summary` - Dashboard performance aggregates
2. `customer_behavior_summary` - Churn prediction features
3. `route_performance_summary` - Operational efficiency tracking
4. `seasonal_patterns` - Forecasting pattern analysis
5. `model_accuracy_summary` - ML model performance tracking
6. `feature_usage_summary` - Feature store monitoring

### Indexing Strategy

**Time-Based Indexes**:
```sql
-- Primary time-based access patterns
CREATE INDEX idx_ts_timestamp_metric_type ON time_series_metrics (timestamp, metric_type, aggregation_level);
CREATE INDEX idx_ts_metric_type_timestamp_desc ON time_series_metrics (metric_type, timestamp DESC);
```

**Dimensional Indexes**:
```sql
-- Customer, route, vehicle segmentation
CREATE INDEX idx_ts_customer_metric_time ON time_series_metrics (customer_id, metric_type, timestamp);
CREATE INDEX idx_ts_route_metric_time ON time_series_metrics (route_id, metric_type, timestamp);
```

**Advanced Indexes**:
```sql
-- JSON field optimization
CREATE INDEX idx_ts_seasonality_gin ON time_series_metrics USING GIN (seasonality);
CREATE INDEX idx_ts_aggregates_gin ON time_series_metrics USING GIN (aggregates);

-- Geographic queries
CREATE INDEX idx_ts_service_area_gist ON time_series_metrics USING GIST (service_area);
```
