# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The TypeScript Zero-Error Remediation feature establishes a systematic approach to drive the backend Node.js/Express codebase to 0 TypeScript errors without changing externally visible behavior or contracts. This feature enables incremental, auditable fixes through phased remediation while maintaining code quality, security, and operational stability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a TypeScript developer, I want to systematically eliminate TypeScript errors in the codebase, so that I can maintain type safety and code quality without breaking existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN TypeScript error remediation begins THEN the system SHALL quantify current errors using `npm run typecheck:count` and `npm run typecheck:top`
2. WHEN foundational fixes are applied THEN the system SHALL address tsconfig hygiene, Express typing, and logger normalization first
3. WHEN shared response types are fixed THEN the system SHALL resolve ApiResponse<T> and Result<T,E> invariants to eliminate downstream errors
4. WHEN vector/Weaviate clusters are addressed THEN the system SHALL fix client types and optional/undefined guards
5. WHEN all phases complete THEN the system SHALL achieve 0 TypeScript errors with `npm run type-check`

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a development team lead, I want all TypeScript fixes to follow strict operational constraints, so that external contracts and database integrity remain unchanged.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any fix is proposed THEN the system SHALL NOT modify contracts/** or public API shapes
2. WHEN database-related changes are needed THEN the system SHALL escalate to DB-Architect agent without making schema changes
3. WHEN security-sensitive code is encountered THEN the system SHALL avoid secrets exposure or cross-tenant changes
4. WHEN commits are made THEN the system SHALL limit changes to â‰¤300 LOC per commit with conventional commit messages
5. IF contract changes are required THEN the system SHALL STOP and escalate to Architecture Agent

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want all TypeScript fixes to pass validation hooks, so that code quality and build integrity are maintained throughout remediation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any file is modified THEN the system SHALL run pre-commit hooks via `./scripts/repo-audit.sh`
2. WHEN hooks fail THEN the system SHALL output failures and NOT propose commits until issues are resolved
3. WHEN dependency validation is needed THEN the system SHALL run `npm run depcruise` with no violations
4. WHEN build validation occurs THEN the system SHALL ensure `npm run build:production` succeeds
5. WHEN smoke tests are required THEN the system SHALL run `npm run test:smoke` and maintain passing status

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a software architect, I want TypeScript remediation to follow a phased approach, so that high-impact fixes are prioritized and risk is minimized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Phase 1 executes THEN the system SHALL fix tsconfig hygiene, Express typing, and logger normalization as keystone fixes
2. WHEN Phase 2 executes THEN the system SHALL resolve shared ApiResponse<T> and Result<T,E> types to eliminate cascading errors
3. WHEN Phase 3 executes THEN the system SHALL address Vector/Weaviate service clusters with client type fixes
4. WHEN Phase 4 executes THEN the system SHALL remove dead code and resolve remaining import path inconsistencies
5. WHEN each phase completes THEN the system SHALL validate error count reduction and build stability

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a code reviewer, I want all TypeScript fixes to produce auditable diffs with clear rationale, so that changes can be reviewed and understood effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN commits are proposed THEN the system SHALL provide unified DIFF for only touched files
2. WHEN shell commands are executed THEN the system SHALL document exact commands including `./scripts/repo-audit.sh`
3. WHEN commit messages are written THEN the system SHALL use conventional format with error count before/after
4. WHEN keystone fixes are made THEN the system SHALL document why the approach reduces errors broadly
5. WHEN follow-up actions are needed THEN the system SHALL include next steps in commit body

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a TypeScript maintainer, I want remediation to follow coding standards that prioritize type safety, so that fixes are sustainable and don't introduce technical debt.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN type fixes are applied THEN the system SHALL prefer type-only changes over behavior modifications
2. WHEN type narrowing is needed THEN the system SHALL use narrowing and small helper functions over casting
3. WHEN external shapes are encountered THEN the system SHALL keep them stable while allowing internal helper evolution
4. WHEN third-party typing issues occur THEN the system SHALL limit `// @ts-ignore` to max 2 occurrences with TODO links
5. WHEN import consistency is addressed THEN the system SHALL prefer `@/` alias consistently over relative imports

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a development operations engineer, I want TypeScript remediation to maintain system stability, so that production deployments and monitoring remain unaffected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN remediation scope is defined THEN the system SHALL limit changes to `backend-implementation/src/**` and `tsconfig*.json`
2. WHEN exclusions are applied THEN the system SHALL avoid `contracts/**`, `docs/**`, `gateway/**`, and `backend-implementation/db/**`
3. WHEN agent boundaries are respected THEN the system SHALL operate as `ts_refactor` agent with defined scope allowlist
4. WHEN escalation is needed THEN the system SHALL stop and hand off per defined escalation rules
5. WHEN success criteria are met THEN the system SHALL achieve 0 errors, no depcruise violations, and successful production build
