### Installation & Startup

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start all monitoring services
./start-recovery-monitoring.sh

# OR start individual components
npm run monitor                    # Full system daemon

### Monitoring Dashboard
- **URL**: `http://localhost:3001/recovery-dashboard`
- **Health Check**: `http://localhost:3001/health`
- **Reports**: `artifacts/reports/` directory

## 📈 Monitoring Priorities

### Phase 1 Critical Path (Weeks 1-4)
1. **Database Models Implementation**
   - Target: 15 Sequelize models
   - Current: 0 implemented
   - Critical blocker for all subsequent development

2. **Authentication System**
   - JWT middleware implementation
   - RBAC system development  
   - Security audit compliance

3. **Core API Endpoints**
   - Customer management endpoints
   - User management CRUD
   - Route management basics

4. **Security Framework**
   - Audit logging system
   - Data encryption implementation
   - Compliance validation

## 🚨 Escalation Triggers

### Immediate Escalation (< 15 minutes)
- Any new critical consistency issues
- Database foundation blocked > 4 hours
- Security system development not started by Week 2
- Complete API endpoint implementation failure

### High Priority Escalation (< 1 hour) 
- Timeline slippage > 3 days
- Quality gate failures
- External integration conflicts
- Multiple parallel agent coordination failures

### Daily Escalation
- Progress rate < 8% per week
- Persistent medium-priority issue accumulation
- Resource allocation inefficiencies

## 📊 Monitoring Metrics

### Technical Health Indicators
- **Database Models Progress**: `0/15 (0%)`
- **API Endpoints Implementation**: `0/50 (0%)`  
- **Security Components**: `0/5 (0%)`
- **External Integrations**: `0/5 (0%)`

### Recovery Timeline Metrics
- **Current Week**: 1 of 12
- **Overall Progress**: ~15%
- **Timeline Health**: BEHIND SCHEDULE
- **Risk Level**: CRITICAL

### Quality Gates
- **Week 1 Checkpoint**: Database models 50% + Auth design complete
- **Week 2 Checkpoint**: Database models 100% + Auth 70% complete
- **Week 3 Checkpoint**: Core API endpoints 100% + Security 80% complete
- **Week 4 Checkpoint**: Phase 1 foundation 90% complete

## 🎯 Agent Coordination Monitoring

### Backend Agent
- **Status**: ACTIVE (should be implementing DB models)
- **Progress**: 20% - needs acceleration
- **Critical Tasks**: DB-001 Sequelize models implementation
- **Blockers**: None currently, but timeline pressure high

### Security Agent  
- **Status**: PENDING START (blocked by backend foundation)
- **Progress**: 0% - will start when DB models ready
- **Critical Tasks**: SEC-001 RBAC implementation
- **Blockers**: Waiting for backend foundation completion

### Database Architect
- **Status**: SHOULD BE ACTIVE 
- **Progress**: 5% - minimal schema alignment
- **Critical Tasks**: Schema-model consistency validation
- **Blockers**: Model implementation coordination needed

### System Architecture Lead
- **Status**: MONITORING REQUIRED
- **Progress**: 70% - architecture well defined
- **Critical Tasks**: Implementation consistency maintenance
- **Blockers**: Need to guide implementation alignment

## 📄 Reports & Documentation

### Automated Reports

- `artifacts/system-design.yml` - Architecture reference

## ⚠️ Current Critical Issues Being Monitored

### 1. **INCOMPLETE BACKEND IMPLEMENTATION** (CRITICAL)

- API contracts promise 50+ endpoints but zero implemented

### 2. **SECURITY FRAMEWORK NOT IMPLEMENTED** (CRITICAL) 
- JWT authentication middleware missing
- RBAC system not implemented
- No audit logging functionality

### 3. **DATABASE CONNECTIVITY BROKEN** (CRITICAL)
- Database models completely missing
- No ORM layer exists
- Health checks will fail

### 4. **API CONTRACT VIOLATIONS** (HIGH)
- 2,530 lines of contracts for non-existent endpoints
- Frontend integration impossible
- Documentation misleading
