    "CRITICAL RECOVERY IN PROGRESS: We are coordinating the recovery of a waste

    The system is only 15% complete with 0% API implementation. We have 8-12 weeks 
    for complete recovery. Every agent must maintain context of the business crisis, 
    understand their critical dependencies, and coordinate seamlessly to prevent
