5. ‚úÖ **Security Standards Documentation**: Analyzed production-ready SSL configuration, enterprise session management, multi-client Redis architecture
6. ‚úÖ **Gap Analysis Complete**: Detailed identification of ML-based threat detection, HSM integration, perfect forward secrecy, post-quantum cryptography requirements
7. ‚úÖ **Hub Coordination Preparation**: Established Security Agent as central coordinator for all 12 subagents in final security implementation

### **IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS**:
- Deploy Security Agent as working hub coordinator for advanced cryptographic controls
- Implement automated key rotation system for JWT and database encryption keys
- Design Hardware Security Module (HSM) integration architecture
- Establish ML-based threat detection and behavioral anomaly detection systems
- Configure perfect forward secrecy and post-quantum cryptography foundation
- Do not perform any git commands like stage, remove, commit or push without explaining what your are doing and the logic behind the git command you are executing. Must get approval for any git commands.
