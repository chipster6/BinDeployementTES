## COORDINATION PLAN

### Phase 1: Requirements Gathering
**Duration**: [time estimate]  
**Objective**: All agents understand requirements and dependencies  
**Tasks**:
1. [ ] Each agent analyzes task and identifies coordination needs
2. [ ] Agents specify requirements from other agents  
3. [ ] Create shared understanding of deliverables
4. [ ] Identify dependencies and potential conflicts

### Phase 2: Planning & Sequencing
**Duration**: [time estimate]  
**Objective**: Determine execution order and parallel work opportunities  
**Tasks**:
1. [ ] Map task dependencies between agents
2. [ ] Identify parallel work opportunities
3. [ ] Create coordinated implementation timeline
4. [ ] Establish coordination checkpoints

### Phase 3: Coordinated Execution  
**Duration**: [time estimate]  
**Objective**: Execute tasks with real-time coordination  
**Tasks**:
1. [ ] Begin coordinated implementation
2. [ ] Maintain real-time coordination through log
3. [ ] Address blockers immediately through coordination
4. [ ] Regular checkpoint updates and validations

### Phase 4: Validation & Integration
**Duration**: [time estimate]  
**Objective**: Ensure all deliverables integrate properly  
**Tasks**:
1. [ ] Cross-agent validation of individual deliverables
2. [ ] Integration testing of coordinated work
3. [ ] Final validation and sign-off
4. [ ] Coordination session completion
