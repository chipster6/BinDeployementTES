# Coordination Session: coord-2025-08-14-security-001

**Agents**: security, system-architecture-lead, database-architect
**Objective**: Critical security vulnerabilities resolution
**Status**: planning
**Priority**: CRITICAL
**Created**: 2025-08-14 17:30:00

## CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUES TO RESOLVE

1. **Database SSL Configuration**: `rejectUnauthorized: false` poses production security risk (database.ts:35)
2. **MFA Backup Codes**: Not implemented - critical for production security (AuthController.ts:715)  
3. **Session Security Features**: Several marked as TODO in UserSession model
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Placeholder implementations with hardcoded zeros

## COORDINATION REQUIREMENTS

### Security Agent Requirements:
- [ ] Analyze SSL certificate validation implementation (needs: database-architect)
- [ ] Review MFA backup codes security requirements (needs: system-architecture-lead)
- [ ] Assess session security TODO items priority (needs: system-architecture-lead)
- [ ] Define production security standards (provides: security-standards)

### System-Architecture-Lead Requirements:
- [ ] Architectural guidance on SSL implementation (needs: database-architect)
- [ ] MFA backup codes system design (needs: security)
- [ ] Session security architecture decisions (needs: security)
- [ ] Performance monitoring architecture (provides: monitoring-design)

### Database-Architect Requirements:
- [ ] SSL configuration hardening strategy (needs: security)
- [ ] Database security configuration review (provides: secure-db-config)
- [ ] Performance monitoring data structure (needs: system-architecture-lead)

## COORDINATION PLAN

1. **Phase 1**: Security agent analyzes critical vulnerabilities → provides threat assessment
2. **Phase 2**: System-architecture-lead designs secure implementations → provides architecture specs  
3. **Phase 3**: Database-architect implements SSL hardening → provides secure configuration
4. **Phase 4**: Cross-agent validation of security implementations
