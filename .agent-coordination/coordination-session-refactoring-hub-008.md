## Hub Coordination Workflow

### **Stage 1: Hub Planning & Specification** (Week 1)
**Hub Agent Tasks**:
1. Finalize service boundary specifications for all 4 critical files
2. Define interface contracts and dependencies
3. Establish quality gates and acceptance criteria
4. Create refactoring execution timeline

**Spoke Agent Preparation**:
- **Backend-Agent**: Review BaseService patterns and prepare implementation templates
- **Security**: Conduct security impact assessment for service separation
- **Testing-Agent**: Design testing strategy for decomposed services

### **Stage 2: Coordinated Execution** (Week 2-3)
**Hub-Orchestrated Implementation**:

#### **Daily Hub Coordination**:
- **Morning Sync**: Hub reviews spoke agent progress
- **Implementation Validation**: Hub validates service implementations
- **Security Clearance**: Hub coordinates security compliance validation
- **Testing Approval**: Hub approves testing strategies and results

#### **Spoke Agent Execution**:
- **Backend-Agent**: Implement services per Hub specifications
- **Security**: Validate security compliance for each service
- **Testing-Agent**: Execute testing per Hub-approved test plans

### **Stage 3: Hub Quality Validation** (Week 4)
**Hub Authority Validation**:
1. SOLID principle compliance verification
2. Service boundary integrity validation
3. Performance impact assessment approval
4. Security grade maintenance confirmation
5. Testing coverage and quality approval

## Hub Coordination Communication Protocol

### **Hub-to-Spoke Communication**:
```yaml
Daily Hub Broadcasts:
