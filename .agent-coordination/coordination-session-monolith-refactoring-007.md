HIGH PRIORITY (1400-1600 lines):
  - ExternalServicesManager.ts: 1,567 lines
  - MasterTrafficCoordinationService.ts: 1,471 lines

MEDIUM PRIORITY (1000-1300 lines):
  - AIMLPerformanceInfrastructure.ts: 1,300+ lines
  - ComprehensivePerformanceOptimizationFramework.ts: 1,200+ lines
  - PredictiveAnalyticsOptimizer.ts: 1,096+ lines
```
