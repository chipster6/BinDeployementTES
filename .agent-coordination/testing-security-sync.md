# Testing-Agent â†” Security Coordination

## SECURITY TESTING VALIDATION SYNC

### Security Implementation Status
- [x] JWT authentication with explicit algorithm validation
- [x] AES-256-GCM encryption for sensitive data
- [x] RBAC with granular permissions (7 user types)
- [x] Session management with Redis
- [x] Field-level encryption for PII data
- [x] HMAC signature validation
- [x] Password hashing with bcrypt
- [x] Audit logging for security events

### Security Testing Requirements
- [ ] Authentication bypass testing
- [ ] Authorization escalation testing
- [ ] Input validation and injection testing
- [ ] Session management security testing
- [ ] Encryption/decryption functionality testing
- [ ] API security testing (OWASP Top 10)
- [ ] Password policy enforcement testing
- [ ] MFA implementation testing

### Critical Security Test Cases
1. JWT token manipulation and validation
2. SQL injection prevention in spatial queries
3. XSS prevention in frontend components
4. CSRF protection validation
5. Rate limiting effectiveness
6. Data encryption at rest validation
7. API key and secret management
8. Webhook signature verification

### Vulnerability Assessment Targets
- Authentication endpoints (/api/auth/*)
- User management endpoints (/api/users/*)
- Customer data endpoints (/api/customers/*)
- Payment processing integration
- External API webhook handlers
- File upload endpoints
- Admin panel access controls

### Coordination Protocol
1. Security agent implements security measures
2. Testing agent creates comprehensive security test suite
3. Testing agent validates security implementations
4. Security agent addresses any vulnerabilities found
5. Testing agent confirms fixes with regression testing
