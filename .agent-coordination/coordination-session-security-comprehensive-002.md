# Coordination Session: coord-2025-08-14-security-comprehensive-002

**Agents**: security, system-architecture-lead, database-architect
**Objective**: Comprehensive resolution of all 12 vulnerabilities identified in code review
**Status**: executing
**Priority**: CRITICAL
**Execution Style**: PARALLEL
**Created**: 2025-08-14 17:35:00

## ALL 12 VULNERABILITIES TO RESOLVE

### MEDIUM PRIORITY (6 vulnerabilities):
1. **Database SSL Configuration**: `rejectUnauthorized: false` poses production security risk (database.ts:35)
2. **MFA Backup Codes**: Not implemented - critical for production security (AuthController.ts:715)
3. **Session Security Features**: Several marked as TODO in UserSession model  
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Placeholder implementations with hardcoded zeros (database.ts:182-184)
5. **SSL Certificate Validation**: Production SSL hardening required
6. **Authentication Flow Gaps**: Session security TODOs need completion

### LOW PRIORITY (6 vulnerabilities):
7. **Console.log Usage**: 13 files using console.log instead of proper logger utility
8. **Incomplete Features**: 45+ TODO comments across routes and controllers
9. **Connection Pool Size**: Max of 120 may be excessive for smaller deployments
10. **Route Implementations**: Multiple endpoints with placeholder implementations
11. **Code Quality**: Various maintenance items requiring attention
12. **Documentation Gaps**: Missing implementation details in various modules
