# DevOps-Agent â†” Performance-Optimization Coordination

## INFRASTRUCTURE PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION SYNC

### Infrastructure Status (DevOps)
- [x] Docker environment optimized (PostgreSQL 16 + PostGIS + Redis 7)
- [x] Database connection pool scaled to 120 connections
- [x] Production CI/CD pipeline with performance gates
- [x] Prometheus + Grafana monitoring stack deployed
- [x] Nginx load balancing and SSL termination
- [x] Container resource limits and health checks
- [x] Automated backup and disaster recovery
- [x] Blue-green deployment with rollback capabilities

### Performance Optimization Status
- [ ] Application performance baseline established
- [ ] Database query optimization implemented
- [ ] Redis caching strategy deployed
- [ ] API response time optimization
- [ ] Memory usage optimization
- [ ] Garbage collection tuning
- [ ] Container resource optimization
- [ ] Load testing validation

### Infrastructure Performance Targets
- Container startup time < 30 seconds
- Database connection pool efficiency > 85%
- Redis cache memory usage < 2GB
- Nginx response time overhead < 10ms
- Docker image size optimization < 500MB
- Health check response time < 1 second
- Backup completion time < 15 minutes
- Deployment time < 5 minutes

### Monitoring Integration
- Prometheus metrics for application performance
- Grafana dashboards for real-time monitoring
- Alert Manager for performance threshold breaches
- Custom metrics for business-critical operations
- Resource utilization trending and forecasting

### Coordination Protocol
1. DevOps agent provides infrastructure metrics and constraints
2. Performance agent analyzes bottlenecks and optimization opportunities
3. DevOps agent implements infrastructure optimizations
4. Performance agent validates improvements with benchmarks
5. Both agents update monitoring thresholds and alerts
