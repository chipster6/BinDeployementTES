# Security â†” External-API-Integration Coordination

## CRITICAL COORDINATION - $2M+ MRR SECURITY

### Security Review Status
- [x] Stripe payment integration security reviewed - PASSED with comprehensive enhancements
- [x] Twilio SMS authentication validated - PASSED with security coordination
- [x] SendGrid email security verified - COVERED via centralized rotation system
- [x] Samsara fleet API authentication checked - COVERED via WebhookSecurityService
- [x] Airtable data sync encryption validated - COVERED via centralized encryption
- [x] Mapbox/Google Maps API key security reviewed - COVERED via monitoring system

### External API Implementation Status
- [x] Stripe webhooks implemented with signature verification, API key rotation, encryption integration
- [x] Twilio webhook security headers configured, phone number encryption, API key rotation
- [x] SendGrid API key rotation mechanism implemented via centralized rotation service
- [x] Samsara webhook authentication implemented via WebhookSecurityService
- [x] Airtable sync encryption at rest/transit verified via centralized security
- [x] Maps API usage restrictions configured via centralized monitoring

### Critical Security Requirements
- API key rotation every 90 days
- Webhook signature verification mandatory
- Rate limiting on all external API calls
- Audit logging for all external API interactions
- Encryption for sensitive data in external API calls

### Coordination Protocol
1. External-API agent implements integration
2. Security agent reviews implementation
3. External-API agent addresses security findings
4. Security agent validates fixes
5. Both agents update this coordination file

### IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED - READY FOR SECURITY AGENT VALIDATION
