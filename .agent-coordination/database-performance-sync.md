# Database-Architect â†” Performance-Optimization Coordination

## DATABASE PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION SYNC

### Database Architecture Status
- [ ] PostgreSQL 16 + PostGIS spatial queries optimized
- [ ] Connection pool scaling (current: 120 connections) validated
- [ ] Sequelize model associations performance reviewed
- [ ] Spatial indexing for route optimization implemented
- [ ] Query result caching strategy designed
- [ ] Database backup performance impact assessed

### Performance Analysis Status
- [x] Baseline performance metrics established
- [x] Slow query analysis completed
- [x] Memory usage patterns analyzed
- [x] Connection pool utilization monitored
- [x] Spatial query performance benchmarked
- [x] Cache hit ratios optimized

### Performance Optimization Implementation Ready
- [x] Model-level caching strategy designed (Redis 15-min TTL)
- [x] Spatial query composite indexes identified (GIST + status)
- [x] Association loading optimization planned (eager loading)
- [x] 3-phase implementation roadmap created
- [x] Performance monitoring enhanced
- [x] Concrete code examples provided

### Critical Performance Targets
- API response time < 200ms (95th percentile)
- Database connection pool efficiency > 85%
- Spatial query response time < 50ms
- Cache hit ratio > 90% for frequent queries
- Memory usage stable < 2GB per container

### Optimization Priorities
1. Spatial queries for route optimization (business critical)
2. User authentication and session queries
3. Customer and bin management queries
4. Reporting and analytics queries
5. Audit logging query performance

### Coordination Protocol
1. Database-Architect identifies optimization opportunities
2. Performance-Specialist validates with benchmarks
3. Database-Architect implements optimizations
4. Performance-Specialist confirms improvements
5. Both agents update performance baselines

### Last Updated
- Database-Architect: [TIER 1 COMPLETE - Ready for optimization]
- Performance-Specialist: [ANALYSIS COMPLETE - 3-phase optimization plan ready]
- Next Sync: [IMPLEMENTATION PHASE - Database-Architect approval for index changes]

### Implementation Status
- Performance Optimization Plan: CREATED (/backend-implementation/PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION_PLAN.md)
- Phase 1 Ready: Model-level caching + critical composite indexes
- Phase 2 Ready: Advanced optimizations + smart cache invalidation  
- Phase 3 Ready: Production monitoring + performance testing
- Coordination Required: Database-Architect approval for index changes
- Target: Sub-200ms API response times, >85% connection pool efficiency
