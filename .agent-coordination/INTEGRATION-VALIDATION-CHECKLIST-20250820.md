## ARCHITECTURAL INTEGRATION TESTS

### API Integration Tests
```bash
# Test security endpoints with MFA encryption
curl -X POST /api/v1/auth/enable-mfa -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

# Test route optimization service completeness
curl -X POST /api/v1/route-optimization/optimize -d "$OPTIMIZATION_REQUEST"

# Test performance monitoring endpoints
curl -X GET /api/v1/performance/metrics
```

### Database Integration Tests
```sql
-- Verify MFA secrets are encrypted
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users WHERE mfa_secret IS NOT NULL AND mfa_secret NOT LIKE 'encrypted:%';

-- Verify route optimization data integrity
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM optimized_routes WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour';

-- Check performance metrics
SELECT * FROM performance_metrics WHERE metric_type = 'route_optimization';
```

### Service Integration Tests
```typescript
// Test RouteOptimizationService completeness
const optimization = await routeOptimizationService.optimizeRoutes(request);
expect(optimization.routes).toBeDefined();
expect(optimization.performance).toBeDefined();

// Test caching integration
const cached = await routeOptimizationService.getCurrentOptimization(optimizationId);
expect(cached).toEqual(optimization);

// Test error handling integration
try {
  await routeOptimizationService.optimizeRoutes(invalidRequest);
} catch (error) {
  expect(error).toBeInstanceOf(ValidationError);
}
