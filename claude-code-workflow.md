# Claude Code Multi-Agent Artifact-Based Workflow System
## Autonomous Subagent Communication & Decision Framework

---

## CORE CONCEPT: ARTIFACT-BASED AGENT COMMUNICATION

Each agent creates specific artifacts that other agents read, analyze, and build upon. This creates a self-organizing workflow where agents make decisions based on previous agents' outputs.

# Error Analysis Report
Generated: 2024-01-15T10:45:00Z

## Critical Issues Detected

### 1. Security Vulnerability
- **Location**: Backend API
- **Issue**: Missing rate limiting on /api/auth/login
- **Impact**: Potential brute force attacks
- **Resolution**: Implementing rate limiter middleware
- **Status**: Auto-fixed in commit abc123

### 2. Database Schema Mismatch
- **Location**: database-schema.sql vs api-contracts.yml
- **Issue**: API expects 'phone_number' field not in schema
- **Impact**: Runtime errors on customer creation
- **Resolution**: Adding migration script
- **Status**: Pending approval

### 3. Performance Degradation
- **Location**: Route optimization service
- **Issue**: O(n²) algorithm for route calculation
- **Impact**: Timeout on >1000 stops
- **Resolution**: Implementing dynamic programming solution
- **Status**: In progress

## Automated Actions Taken
1. Created hotfix branch: fix/security-rate-limiting
2. Generated migration: 002_add_phone_number.sql
3. Notified performance-optimization-specialist

## Recommendations
- Implement automated security scanning in CI/CD
- Add performance benchmarks to test suite
- Create alert thresholds for API response times

## BENEFITS OF THIS ARTIFACT-BASED APPROACH

1. **Full Autonomy**: Agents make decisions based on artifact content
2. **Clear Dependencies**: Each agent knows exactly what artifacts to read
3. **Traceable Decisions**: All decisions are documented in artifacts
4. **Error Recovery**: Error agent can detect and fix inconsistencies
5. **Progressive Enhancement**: Each agent builds upon previous work
6. **Validation Gates**: Automatic quality checks before proceeding
7. **Self-Documenting**: Artifacts serve as documentation

This system creates a truly autonomous workflow where agents communicate through artifacts, make informed decisions, and self-correct when issues arise.
